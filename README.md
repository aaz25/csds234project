# The Covid-19 Data Visualization Dashboard

This is a Covid-19 data visualization dashboard that displays incidence, prevalence, and mortality data from 3 days ago to 10 days ago. The dashboard itself can be viewed [here](https://aaz25.github.io/csds234project/). The data is from the [Our World in Data Covid-19 Data Set](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data).

Mouse over the graphs to see counts from individual days, and use the dropdown menu on the left-hand side to view data from a specific continent.
